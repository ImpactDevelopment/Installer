# Contributing to the Installer

## I have a question
Issues aren't intended for handling questions. You're much better off contacting us through one of these methods [Discord]()

## I found a bug
Before reporting a bug, please take the time to check if someone else has already. Search the [issues list] for keywords that might match your issue.

If you can't find the bug already reported, we'd greatly appreciate it if you report it to us. Click the [new issue] button and select "bug". Then try and follow the template to provide us with useful information in fixing the issue.

## I have an idea
That's great! Similar to bugs, it's possible someone else has already reported it, so please check the [issues list] to see if you can find anything matching your idea.

If not, we welcome any suggestion, but please don't be offended if we don't think it'll fit well with the project. Click the [new issue] button, choose "enhancement" and try to follow the template to provide us with useful information.

## I want to fix a bug or implement an idea
Brilliant. You'll first want to ensure you have [forked us][fork], cloned your fork and [setup a development environment][devenv].

Once that's done you can checkout a new branch, make your changes to it, publish it and open a Pull Request asking us to merge the changes in your branch.

Please see  [Creating a Pull Request from a Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). If you're brand new to git checkout [Try Git](http://try.github.io/) or one of these [awesome tutorials](https://gist.github.com/jaseemabid/1321592)
